## General Information
- The objective is to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market. 
- This uses day.csv - Bike Sharing dataset.

## Conclusions
- EDA was completed and few features have been selected to build Multiple Linear Regression model. The Model is stable. The data set was split into Train and Test dataset. The model was tested successfully on the Test dataset.

## Technologies Used
- Python libraries have been used. SKLearn and statsmodel libraries we used to build the regression model

<!-- As the libraries versions keep on changing, it is recommended to mention the version of library used in this project -->
